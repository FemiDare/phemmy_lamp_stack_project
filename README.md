Lamp stack course project

I registered for a free profile account on AWS and having done that I launched an instance using the linux operating system (Ubuntu) and created a keypair which was downloaded to my local download folder.

From the CLI I changed directory into the downloads folder where my keypairs were located and proceeded to connect or "ssh-ed" to my AWS instance, hence transitioning into a pure linux operating system.

As with standard practices I proceeded to update my operating system using the "sudo apt update" command.

I then proceeded to install apache2 on my instance using the command "sudo apt install apache2" and then ran the "sudo systemctl status apache2" command to check/verify that apache2 was properly installed on my instatnce.
